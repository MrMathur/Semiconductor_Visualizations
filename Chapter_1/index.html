      <p class="col-lg-10">
        Before we begin our journey looking at how semiconductor devices work, we need to understand the inner workings
        of atoms. The Hydrogen Atom, due to its simple structure, has been extensively studied, and
        provides a good starting point to understand the fundamentals, before we move onto semiconductors such as
        Silicon.

        <h1>The Subatomic Particles</h1>
        <p>Each atom of any element is composed of certain subatomic particles. These subatomic particles are the
          electron, the proton and the neutron.</p>
        <p>An electron is a negative charge carrier, with negligible mass. Each element has as many electrons as its
          atomic number. A proton is a positive charge carrier, and contributes to the mass of the atom. Together, these
          two subatomic particles ensure that the atom is neutral, or has a net charge of 0.</p>
        <p>A hydrogen atom has 1 proton and 1 electron, but no neutron.</p>

        <h1>The Bohr Model</h1>
        <p>Niels Bohr proposed the Bohr Model of the Atom in 1915.</p>
        <p>The Bohr Model contains some errors, but it is important because it describes most of the accepted features
          of atomic theory without all of the high-level math of the modern version.</p>
        <p>The Bohr Model is a planetary model in which the negatively charged electrons orbit a small, positively
          charged nucleus similar to the planets orbiting the sun.</p>
        <p>In the case of the Hydrogen atom, the nucleus contains only the proton, and the elctron revolves
          around it due to Coulomb forces.</p>

        <h1>What can we observe?</h1>
        <p>As technology became more sophisticated, we developed ways of locating these subatomic particles in space.
        </p>
        <p>We found the behaviour of protons and neutrons to mimic the Bohr's Model - they always stayed fixed inside
          the nucleus.</p>
        <p>The electron, however, behaved differently, and was located at a different location everytime it was
          measured.</p>
        <p>In the adjoining visualization, press 'ENTER' to locate the position of the electron at any given time.</p>

        <h1>What scientists found?</h1>
        <p>Scientists repeated this experiment again and again and again, until they had more than a million
          observations. They used this data of measured locations to draw correlations about the existence of electrons
          with respect to the nucleus.</p>
        <p>As you can see in the adjoining visualization, most of the measurements they made were around the nucleus.
          Moreover, as the distance from the nucleus increased, the density of measurements became sparser.</p>

      <div class="col-lg-4">
        <h1>Radius vs. Frequency</h1>
        <p>Since there seemed to be no angular correlation for the Hydrogen atom, researchers sweeped across the
          nucleus, and linearly mapped all measurements to their distance from the nucleus. The following graph was
          observed:</p>

        </svg>
        <p>They found that the highest number of measurements were at the Bohr Radius, which was also defined as the
          average position of all measurements. </p>

    <div class="row conclusion-row" id="scene_6">
      <div class="col-lg-4">
        <h1>Where is the electron?</h1>
        <p>The electron can exist anywhere in space - right next to the nucleus, or on the other side of the universe.
          However, this experiment shows that it is most likely to be found around its average position.</p>
        <p>To tackle this, scientists defined a mathematically determined orbital. An orbital is defined as a region
          where the electron is likely to be found at least 95% of the time.</p>
        <p>The Hydrogen atom, at room temperature, has its electron in the 1s orbital, which takes a spherical shape.

        <h1>For the sake of simplicity</h1>
        <p>We now understand that an electron's position is not fixed, and it can exist anywhere. However, such a
          definition would not allow us to study its interaction with other charge carriers, which is necessary to
          solidify the concepts of semiconductor physics</p>
        <p>Hence, for the sake of simplicity, in the following lessons, we will visualize the electron as being static.
          However, the visualization of the orbital of the electron should remind you, that it is not in fact so!</p>
        <p>You might think that a Hydrogen atom has only one orbital. However, if the electron gains energy, it can
          transition into other orbitals. To learn more, go through the next chapter</p>
