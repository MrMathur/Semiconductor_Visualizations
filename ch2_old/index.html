      <div class="col-lg-1"></div>
      <p class="col-lg-10">
        So far, we have seen that an electron may exist in the form of different orbitals. A key concept for
        understanding semiconductor physics, is understanding the variation of energy levels across these different
        orbitals. How is the energy of an orbital defined? What influences its energy? These are some of the
        questions we'll answer in this chapter.

        <h1>The Subatomic Particles</h1>
        <p>Once again, we look at the simplistic case of a Hydrogen atom, that consists of one electron and one proton.
        </p>
        <p>These subatomic particles are equally, but oppositely, charged.</p>

      <div class="col-lg-4">
        <h1>Coulomb Force of Attraction</h1>
        <p>Due to these charges, there is a force of attraction that acts on these particles.</p>
        <p>This force is governed by the Coulomb law, which states that \[F = {-k * q1 * q2 \over r^2}\]</p>
        <p>Here k is a constant, q1 and q2 are the charges of both particles, and r is the distance between the two.</p>

      <div class="col-lg-4">
        <h1>The Potential Energy</h1>
        <p>If we consider the two charges as a system, the coulombic force gives rise to a potential energy. This energy
          is governed by the equation \[E = {-k * q1 * q2 \over r}\]</p>
        <svg id="pe-viz"></svg>
        <p>As with any potential, it is defined as 0 at a reference point.</p>
        <p>The potential energy of all other points is
          defined as the negative of the work done by an external force, in moving the charge from that point to the
          reference point.</p>

      <div class="col-lg-4">
        <h1>Total Energy of Electron</h1>
        <p>The classical model assumed that the electron revolves around the proton, giving rise to a kinetic energy
          defined by \[E = {1* m * v^2\over 2\ }\]</p>
        <svg id="d3-viz"></svg>
        <p>The total energy of the electron would hence be the sum of the potential and kinetic energies, as shown.</p>
        <p>We can see that these are change with changing radii of the electron.</p>

        <h1>Absorption of Energy</h1>
        <p>When light is shone on hydrogen gas, the molecules may absorb energy depending on the wavelength of light.
        </p>
        <svg id="d3-viz"></svg>
        <button type="button" onclick="reset()">Click to reset!</button>
        <p>If the classical model was correct, we would observe all light being absorbed by the gas, and see a dark
          screen throughout as a result.</p>

        <svg id="sec-viz"></svg>
        <button type="button" onclick="reset()">Click to reset!</button>
        <p>Instead, the screen would light up on most wavelegnth, indicating that the gas does not absorbs all
          wavelength.</p>
        <p>Which wavelengths do does the Hydrogen molecule absorb?</p>

        <p>As we saw, only certain wavelength were absorbed by the hydrogen gas.</p>
        <svg id="sec-viz"></svg>
        <button type="button" onclick="reset()">Click to reset!</button>
        <p>Moreover, the hydrogen atom would also release energy, emitting photons of light, lighting up the screen.</p>
        <p>Which photons does the Hydrogen gas release?</p>

        <h1>Orbitals and Energy</h1>
        <p>The orbitals can only exist at discrete energy levels, proving the classical model incorrect.</p>
        <svg id="sec-viz"></svg>
        <button type="button" onclick="reset()">Click to reset!</button>
        <p>Energy transtitions can only happen when the exact amount of energy is transferred.</p>
        <p>Can you reach the 3s orbital by shining the correct wavelengths?</p>
