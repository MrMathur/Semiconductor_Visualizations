      <p class="col-lg-10">
        Before we begin our journey looking at how semiconductor devices work, we need to understand the inner workings
        of atoms. The Hydrogen Atom, due to its simple structure, provides a good starting point to understand the
        fundamentals, before we move onto semiconductors such as Silicon.

        <h1>The Subatomic Particles</h1>
        <p>A hydrogen atom has one electron, one proton, and no neutrons .</p>

        <p>What is the net charge of the hydrogen atom?</p>

        <p>What is the total weight of the hydrogen atom?</p>

        <h1>The Classical Model</h1>
        <p>The Classical Model is a planetary model.</p>

        <p>Why is the proton stationary and only the electron orbits?</p>

        <p>This simple model based on classical physics cannot explain many of the atom’s properties.</p>

        <h1>The Quantum Model</h1>
        <p>At such a small scale, we can never predict the exact location of a particle. At any point in time, in
          principle we can obtain the electron position only if we perform a “measurement.” If we repeat the
          measurements many times, we can obtain the probability of finding the electron at various positions.</p>

        <p>Perform the measurement many times and see if you find a pattern. Where is most likely to find the electron?

        <h1>Probability vs. Distance</h1>
        <p>You might have guessed the likelihood of finding the electron increases the closer you get to the nucleus. To
          test this impression, let’s count the number of times electron is found between these two spherical shapes.
        </p>

        <p>Where do you count the most? The closer to the nucleus , the farther, or somewhere in the middle?</p>

        <p>As we zoom out and increase the number of experiments, we can see that a few times the electron may be
          located far from the nucleus. However, the probability drops rapidly.</p>

        <p>What you saw was the electron in its lowest energy level which is the most stable condition. If we excite
          the electron by, for example, shining light on it, the electron can go to the next energy level which is the
          2s Orbital.</p>

        <h1>For the sake of simplicity</h1>
        <p>We now understand that an electron's position is not fixed, and it can exist anywhere. However, such a
          definition would not allow us to study its interaction with other charge carriers, which is necessary to
          solidify the concepts of semiconductor physics</p>
        <p>Hence, for the sake of simplicity, in the following lessons, we will visualize the electron as being static.
          However, the visualization of the orbital of the electron should remind you, that it is not in fact so!</p>
