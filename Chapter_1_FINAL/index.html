      <p class="col-lg-10">
        Before we begin our journey looking at how semiconductor devices work, we need to understand the inner workings
        of atoms. The Hydrogen Atom, due to its simple structure, has been extensively studied, and
        provides a good starting point to understand the fundamentals, before we move onto semiconductors such as
        Silicon.

        <h1>The Subatomic Particles</h1>
        <p>Each atom of any element is composed of certain subatomic particles. These subatomic particles are the
          electron, the proton and the neutron.</p>
        <p>An electron is a negative charge carrier, with negligible mass. Each element has as many electrons as its
          atomic number. A proton is a positive charge carrier, and contributes to the mass of the atom. Together, these
          two subatomic particles ensure that the atom is neutral, or has a net charge of 0.</p>
        <p>A hydrogen atom has 1 proton and 1 electron, but no neutron.</p>

      <div class="col-lg-4">
        <h1>The Classical Model</h1>
        <p>The Classical Model is a planetary model in which the negatively charged electrons orbit a small, positively
          charged nucleus similar to the planets orbiting the sun.</p>
        <p>In the case of the Hydrogen atom, the nucleus contains only the proton, and the elctron revolves
          around it due to Coulomb forces.</p>
        <p>The Classical Model contains some errors, but it is important because it describes most of the accepted
          features
          of atomic theory without all of the high-level math of the modern version.</p>

        <h1>The Quantum Model</h1>
        <p>As our understanding became clearer, we developed ways of predicting the location of these subatomic
          particles in space.
        </p>
        <p>We found the behaviour of protons and neutrons to mimic the Classical Model - they always stayed fixed inside
          the nucleus.</p>
        <p>The electron, however, behaved differently, and was located at a different location everytime.</p>
        <p>In the adjoining visualization, press 'ENTER' to locate the position of the electron at any given time.</p>

        <h1>Exploring the Distribution</h1>
        <p>Scientists plotted more than a million
          of these predictions along space. This data of predicted locations was used to draw correlations between the
          location of electrons
          and the distance to the nucleus.</p>
        <p>As you can see in the adjoining visualization, most of the predictions they made were around the nucleus.
          Moreover, as the distance from the nucleus increased, the density of predictions became sparser.</p>

    <div class="row graph-row" id="scene_5">
      <div class="col-lg-4">
        <h1>Probability vs. Distance</h1>
        <p>Since there seemed to be no angular correlation for the Hydrogen atom, researchers sweeped across the
          nucleus, and linearly mapped all predictions to their distance from the nucleus. The following graph was
          observed:</p>

      <div class="col-lg-4">
        <h1>Zooming Out</h1>
        <p>As we zoom out, we can see that even though some predictions are farther from the nucleus, most of the times
          the electron is close to the nucleus.</p>
        <svg id="d3-viz-final">

        </svg>
        <p>They found that the highest number of predictoins were at the Bohr Radius, which was also defined as the
          average position of all predictions. </p>

        <h1>The 2s Orbital</h1>
        <p>Upon repeating the experiment multiple times, scietists found a variety of different distributions that
          existed. Each of these different distributions is called an "orbital".</p>
        <svg id="d3-viz-final-2s">

        </svg>
        <p>The 2s orbital has electrons farther from the nucleus, indicating they're more loosely bound than the
          previous 1s orbital electrons.</p>

        <h1>The 2px Orbital</h1>
        <p>The 2p orbital breaks the radial symmetry so far observed. Electrons were found to be closer along a
          particular axis,
          mimicing the shape of a dumbbell.</p>
        <svg id="d3-viz-final-2p">

        <p>The adjoining visualization shows a 2px orbital, where the electrons are closer to the x-axis. </p>

      <div class="col-lg-4">
        <h1>2py and 2pz</h1>
        <p>Similarly, electrons also exist in 2py and 2pz orbitals. These are identical to the 2px orbitals, other than
          their spatial orientation.</p>
        <svg id="d3-viz-final-2p">

        <p>The adjoining plot shows a 2py orbital.</p>

        <h1>For the sake of simplicity</h1>
        <p>We now understand that an electron's position is not fixed, and it can exist anywhere. However, such a
          definition would not allow us to study its interaction with other charge carriers, which is necessary to
          solidify the concepts of semiconductor physics</p>
        <p>Hence, for the sake of simplicity, in the following lessons, we will visualize the electron as being static.
          However, the visualization of the orbital of the electron should remind you, that it is not in fact so!</p>
