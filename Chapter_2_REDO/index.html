        Before we begin our journey looking at how semiconductor devices work, we need to understand the inner workings
        of atoms. The Hydrogen Atom, due to its simple structure, has been extensively studied, and
        provides a good starting point to understand the fundamentals, before we move onto semiconductors such as
        Silicon.

        <h1>The Subatomic Particles</h1>
        <p>Each atom of any element is composed of certain subatomic particles. These subatomic particles are the
          electron, the proton and the neutron.</p>
        <p>An electron is a negative charge carrier, with negligible mass. Each element has as many electrons as its
          atomic number. A proton is a positive charge carrier, and contributes to the mass of the atom. Together, these
          two subatomic particles ensure that the atom is neutral, or has a net charge of 0.</p>
        <p>A hydrogen atom has 1 proton and 1 electron, but no neutron.</p>
