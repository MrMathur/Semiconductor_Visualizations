        Before we begin our journey looking at how semiconductor devices work, we need to understand the inner workings
        of atoms. The Hydrogen Atom, due to its simple structure, has been extensively studied, and
        provides a good starting point to understand the fundamentals, before we move onto semiconductors such as
        Silicon.

        <p>Since there seemed to be no angular correlation for the Hydrogen atom, researchers sweeped across the
          nucleus, and linearly mapped all measurements to their distance from the nucleus. The following graph was
